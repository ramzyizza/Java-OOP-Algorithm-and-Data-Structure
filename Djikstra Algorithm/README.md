## Problem Set

 1. For the following graph, calculate the distance of the shortest path when the starting node is node-a and the destination node is node-i. Try calculating it manually (using pen and paper) and match the result with the code implementation. 
 2. Try to fully understand the code and modify it so that it also prints the actual shortest path. For example, the shortest path from A to H (graph at 7.2.1) is via A-D-G-H. Show which parts of the code (and how) did you modify it
