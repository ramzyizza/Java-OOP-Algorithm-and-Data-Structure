## Problem Set

1. Try implementing the adjacency matrix-version for the graph representation.
2. Modify the method bfs() so that it works for the adjacency matrix-version.
3. Add a method named dfs() that performs Depth First Search to the graph.

## CHAPTER 6: GRAPH

**6.1 Learning Objectives**

1.  Understand the graph data structure.
2.  Represent a graph using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
3.  Understand the concept of BFS and DFS in a graph.

**6.2 Material**

**6.2.1 Graph**
