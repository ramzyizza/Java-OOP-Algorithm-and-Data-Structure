10.  Chapter X: String Matching Algorithm (Na√Øve & KMP)
11.  Chapter XI: Geometry Algorithm (Convex Hull Problem)
12.  Activities, Assignments, and Homework

### Extra Notes
-   **Activities**: These are practical tasks that help solidify the understanding of OOP concepts. They are hands-on and are geared towards applying the theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.
-   **Assignments**: These are more intensive tasks that dive deep into algorithms and data structures. They are comprehensive and cover a wide range of topics discussed in the chapters.
-   **Homework**: Homework encompasses both OOP concepts and algorithms and data structures. They are meant to be done outside of the usual study time and are a combination of both theory and practical tasks.
