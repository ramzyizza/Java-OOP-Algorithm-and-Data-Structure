## Problem Set
 1. Using an array, create a program that can add up all the numbers inserted by the user. Note that the program will read the number of numbers to be inserted and the numbers to be inserted. Do the same as the question above, but use a linked list.
 2. Create an array that stores 10 numbers, then triple each number.
 3. Create a program to reverse the order of a string of characters inserted by the user (eg REVELATION -> NOITALEVER)
 4. Create a program that checks whether a string is a palindrome (a palindrome is a string that reads from the forward or backward, for example TACOCAT)
 5. Create a program that calculates the parking fee that must be paid for each car in the parking lot. Each car has information on the car model and parking time. Assume the rate is Rp. 2000 per hour.

## CHAPTER II: ARRAY & LINKED LIST & THEIR APPLICATIONS

**2.1 Learning Objectives**

-   Understand arrays and linked lists.
-   Implement arrays and linked lists and discern when to use them.
-   Understand stacks and queues.
-   Implement stacks and queues and know when to use them.

**2.2 Theory**

**2.2.1 Array**

-   Basic data structure with a collection of variables of the same type.
-   Types: One-dimensional (vector) and two-dimensional (matrix).
-   Java treats arrays as primitive types that are treated as objects.
-   Ways to declare and initialize arrays in Java.
-   Accessing and manipulating array elements.
-   Searching and replacing elements in an array.

**2.2.2 Linked List**

-   Another basic data structure for data storage.
-   Uses separate memory spaces called nodes, connected using pointers.
-   Two essential types: Node (main body) and Pointer (head of the list).
-   Various methods to process and manipulate linked lists, including `insertFirst()`, `insertLast()`, `deleteFirst()`, `deleteLast()`, and `displayList()`.
-   Using built-in Java LinkedList class.

**2.2.3 Stack**

-   Linear data structure allowing access only to the last item inserted.
-   Follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) mechanism.
-   Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
-   Basic operations: Initializing stack, Push, Pop, isEmpty, and printStack.
-   Using Java's built-in Stack class.

**2.2.4 Queue**

-   Linear data structure similar to stack but operates on opposite ends.
-   Follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) mechanism.
-   Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
-   Basic operations: Initializing queue, Enqueue, Dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, and printQueue.
-   Practical application example: Banking queue using Java's LinkedList.
